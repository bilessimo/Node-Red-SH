DISCLAIMER:  

You shouldn’t be reading this. And I must be honest: I’m don’t really know what I’m doing. I’m not a programmer or work with anything tech related.  

This project is me following some tutorials and trying to learn some basics on Arduino, sensors, Node-Red, MQTT and other things that relate to IoT. All as a hobby, nothing professional. It’s just an old dog trying to learn new tricks. 

So the code available here it’s me trying to learn, not to teach. There are probably much more efficient and elegant ways to do the things I do here. 

I will link the tutorials I follow to solve the issues I face in the code itself. You will find much more robust knowledge in these tutorials. 

Also, English it’s not my native language and I learn, mostly, from comic books, sci-fi novels and movies. So, don’t expect any erudition.
